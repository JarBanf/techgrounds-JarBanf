# Well Architected Framework

AWS Well-Architected Framework (WAF) helps cloud architects build secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient infrastructure for a variety of applications and workloads. Built around six pillars—operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, cost optimization, and sustainability—AWS Well-Architected provides a consistent approach for customers and partners to evaluate architectures and implement scalable designs.

The AWS Well-Architected Framework includes domain-specific lenses, hands-on labs, and the AWS Well-Architected Tool. The AWS Well-Architected Tool, available at no cost in the AWS Management Console, provides a mechanism for regularly evaluating workloads, identifying high-risk issues, and recording improvements.

AWS also provides access to an ecosystem of hundreds of members in the AWS Well-Architected Partner Program. Engage a partner in your area to help analyze and review your applications.

<ins>General design principles</ins>

The Well-Architected Framework identifies a set of general design principles to facilitate good design in the cloud:
- Stop guessing your capacity needs
- Test systems at production scale
- Automate with architectural experimentation in mind
- Consider evolutionary architectures
- Drive architectures using data
- Improve through game days

<ins>The pillars of the framework:</ins>

1. Operational excellence
2. Security
3. Reliability
4. Performance efficiency
5. Cost optimization
6. Sustainability

<ins>1. Operational excellence</ins>

The following are design principles for operational excellence in the cloud:

- Perform operations as code
- Make frequent, small, reversible changes
- Refine operations procedurs frequently
- Anticipate failure
- Learn from all operational failures
- Use managed services
- Implement observability for actionable insights

<ins>2. Security</ins>

In the cloud, there are a number of principles that can help you strengthen your workload security:

- Implement a strong identity foundation
- Maintain traceability
- Apply security at all layers
- Automate security best practices
- Protect data in transit and at rest
- Keep people away from data
- Prepare for security events

<ins>3. Reliability</ins>

There are five design principles for reliability in the cloud:

- Automatically recover from failure
- Test recovery procedures
- Scale horizontally to increase aggregate workload availability
- Stop guessing capacity
- Manage change in automation

<ins>4. Performance efficiency</ins>

There are five design principles for performance efficiency in the cloud: 

- Democratize advanced technologies
- Go global in minutes
- Use serverless architectures
- Experiment more often
- Consider mechanical sympathy

<ins>5. Cost optimization</ins>

There are five design principles for cost optimization in the cloud:

- Implement Cloud Financial Management
- Adopt a consumption model
- Measure overall efficiency
- Stop spending money on undifferentiated heavy lifting
- Analyze and attribute expenditure

<ins>6. Sustainability</ins>

There are six design principles for sustainability in the cloud: 

- Understand your impact
- Establish sustainability goals
- Maximize utilization
- Anticipate and adopt new, more efficient hardware and software offerings
- Use managed services
- Reduce the downstream impact of your workloads
