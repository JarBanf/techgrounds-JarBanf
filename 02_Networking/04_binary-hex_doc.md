# Counting in binary and hex
**Binary**:  
Binary is a base-2 number system invented by Gottfried Leibniz that's made up of only two numbers or digits: 0 (zero) and 1 (one). This numbering system is the basis for all binary code, which writes digital data such as the computer processor instructions used with your devices every day.

The 0s and 1s in binary represent OFF or ON, respectively. In a transistor, a "0" represents no flow of electricity, and a "1" represents electricity is allowed to flow. The transistor is the primary building block of all microchips. It is what creates the binary 0's and 1's (bits) your computer uses to communicate. 

**Hexadecimal**:  
Hexadecimal, also known as hex or base 16, is a system we can use to write and share numerical values. In that way it's no different than the most famous of numeral systems (the one we use every day): decimal. Decimal is a base 10 number system (perfect for beings with 10 fingers), and it uses a collection of 10 unique digits, which can be combined to positionally represent numbers.

Hex, like decimal, combines a set of digits to create large numbers. Hex uses the standard 0-9, but it also incorporates six digits you wouldn't usually expect to see creating numbers: A, B, C, D, E, and F.
