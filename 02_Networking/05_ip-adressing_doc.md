# IP Adressing
**IP address**:  
The internet needs a way to differentiate between different computers, routers, and websites. An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique address that identifies a device on the internet or a local network.

**Two versions of IP**
- IPv4
- IPv6

<ins>IPv4</ins>  
IPv4 is actually the first version of IP to be used. It uses a 32-bit address that consist of a string of numbers separated by periods. This 32-bit address space provides almost 4.3 billion unique addresses, though some IP blocks are reserved for special uses. IPv4 addresses are expressed as a set of four numbers. Each number in the set can range from 0 to 255. So, the full IPv4 addressing range goes from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255.  
For example: 192.168.10.150

<ins>IPv6</ins>  
The IPv6 is a newer version of IP that uses a 128-bit address format that consist of a string of both numbers and letters seperated by periods. IPv6 addresses are expresses as a set of 8 hexadecimal values. Each hexadecimal value in the set can range from 0000 to FFFF. So the full IPv6 adressing range goes from 0000.0000.0000.0000.0000.0000.0000.0000 to FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF.  
For example: 3002:0bd6:0000:0000:0000:ee00:0033:6778

**Types of IP addresses**
- Private IP addresses
- Public IP addresses

<ins>Private IP addresses</ins>  
Every device that connects to your internet network has a private IP address. Your router needs a way to identify these devices separately, and many items need a way to recognize each other. Therefore, your router generates private IP addresses that are unique identifiers for each device that differentiate them on the network.

<ins>Public IP addresses</ins>  
A public IP address is the primary address associated with your whole network. your public IP address is provided to your router by your ISP. Typically, ISPs have a large pool of IP addresses that they distribute to their customers. Your public IP address is the address that all the devices outside your internet network will use to recognize your network.

**Public IP addresses come in two forms**
- Dynamic
- Static

<ins>Dynamic IP addresses</ins>  
Dynamic IP addresses change automatically and regularly. ISPs buy a large pool of IP addresses and assign them automatically to their customers. Periodically, they re-assign them and put the older IP addresses back into the pool to be used for other customers. The rationale for this approach is to generate cost savings for the ISP. There are security benefits, too, because a changing IP address makes it harder for criminals to hack into your network interface.

<ins>Static IP addresses</ins>  
In contrast to dynamic IP addresses, static addresses remain consistent. Once the network assigns an IP address, it remains the same. Most individuals and businesses do not need a static IP address, but for businesses that plan to host their own server, it is crucial to have one. This is because a static IP address ensures that websites and email addresses tied to it will have a consistent IP address. Vital if you want other devices to be able to find them consistently on the web.
