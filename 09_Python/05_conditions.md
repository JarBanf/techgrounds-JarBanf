# Conditions

Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

- Equals: `a == b`
- Not Equals: `a != b`
- Less than: `a < b`
- Less than or equal to: `a <= b`
- Greater than: `a > b`
- Greater than or equal to: `a >= b`

These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.

An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword.
