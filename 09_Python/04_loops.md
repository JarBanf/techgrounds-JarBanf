# Loops

Python has two primitive loop commands:

<ins>`while` loops</ins>  
With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.

<ins>`for` loops</ins>  
A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.

## Key-terms


## Assignment

<ins>Exercise 1</ins>  

- Create a new script.
- Create a variable x and give it the value 0.
- Use a while loop to print the value of x in every iteration of the loop. After printing, the value of x should increase by 1. The loop should run as long as x is smaller than or equal to 10.

<ins>Exercise 2</ins>

- Create a new script.
- Copy the code below into your script.

    ```py
    for i in range(10):
    # do something here
    ```

- Print the value of i in the for loop. You did not manually assign a value to i. Figure out how its value is determined.
- Add a variable x with value 5 at the top of your script.
- Using the for loop, print the value of x multiplied by the value of i, for up to 50 iterations.

<ins>Exercise 3</ins>

- Create a new script.
- Copy the array below into your script.

    ```
    arr = ["Shikha", "Casper", "Bart", "Ruben", "Ulviye"]
    ```

- Use a for loop to loop over the array. Print every name individually.
