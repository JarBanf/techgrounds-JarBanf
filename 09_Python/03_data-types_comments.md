# Data types and Comments

**Data types**

In programming, data type is an important concept.

Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.

Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:
- Text Type:        `str`
- Numeric Types: 	`int`, `float`, `complex`
- Sequence Types: 	`list`, `tuple`, `range`
- Mapping Type: 	`dict`
- Set Types: 	    `set`, `frozenset`
- Boolean Type: 	`bool`
- Binary Types:     `bytes`, `bytearray`, `memoryview`
- None Type: 	    `NoneType`

**Comments**

Comments can be used to:

- explain Python code.
- make the code more readable.
- prevent execution when testing code.

## Assignment

<ins>Exercise 1</ins>

- Create a new script.
- Copy the code below into your script.

    ```py
    a = 'int'
    b = 7
    c = False
    d = "18.5"
    ```

- Determine the data types of all four variables ( a, b, c, d) using a built-in function.
- Make a new variable x and give it the value b + d. Print the value of x. This will raise an error. Fix it so that print(x) prints a float.
- Write a comment above every line of code that tells the reader what is going on in your script.

<ins>Exercise 2</ins>

- Create a new script.
- Use the input() function to get input from the user. Store that input in a variable.
- Find out what data type the output of input() is. See if it is different for different kinds of input (numbers, words, etc.).
