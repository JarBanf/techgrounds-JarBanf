# <a id="top">Decisions Document</a> 📗 💭 💡 🔨
While implementing the infrastructure design, I will make decisions about, among other things, the services I will use.   
In this document I will write down my considerations and explain my decisions. This document will also contain my assumptions and improvements.  
This serves as the basis for my design documentation.

## Customer Background Information
### 🏫 🏢 🏦 🏤
<ins>Background information about the customer that can be useful when designing the cloud infrastructure.</ins>

### Organization
- Based in NL
- Small office, including administration department
- One IT administrator who has yet to join the team
- The IT administrator is a senior with good knowledge of the cloud services and will be updating and patching the infrastructure and services him/her-self after deployment.

### Customer Goals
- A working website which can be accessed from the internet
- An admin / management server
- Only the cloud infrastructure is needed, migration of data will be done in-house.
- No support plans wanted.
- In the future: 30+ virtual windows workstations. (at the moment 30 on-premise workstations)

### Webserver
- Simple website, nothing fancy
- Attached to a database
- 99% of traffic from NL
- During office hours more traffic to the website
- Expecting a bit of traffic growth but nothing relevant
- Current on-premise webserver way too big for their usage

### Admin / Management server
- Only the one IT administrator will be accessing the server.
- From this server will the future 30+ virtual workstations be administered.

### Security
- Protection against attacks and hacking will be done in-house

## Cloud Infrastructure Requirements
### ☁️ 📋 ✅
<ins>A description of all requirements</ins>  

🔵 = Initial requirements.  
🟠 = Additional requirements following meeting with product owner on Wed 10 Jan ’24.

### Network
- 🔵 The following IP ranges are used: 10.10.10.0/24 & 10.20.20.0/24.
- 🟠 Subnet where future workstations will be located must have at least 30 usable IP addresses, excluding room for possible growth. Large growth is not expected in the short term.

### Web server & Database
- 🟠 Website 24/7 online.
- 🔵 The web server must be installed in an automated manner.
- 🟠 SQL database needed for the website; post script deployment must be able to run.
- 🟠 We do not need to connect the database to the website, but we do need to ensure that connection can be made.
- 🟠 Scalability of the webserver; is not clear whether the customer wants this, but it does sound interesting according to the product owner.

### Admin / management server
- 🔵 The admin / management server must be reachable with a public IP.
- 🔵 The admin / management server must only be accessible from trusted locations (office/admin’s home).
- 🟠 Admin / management server must run on windows
- 🟠 Admin server may not go down together with the workstations in the event of a malfunction.
- 🟠 Access to admin / management server: use my own IP address during development. In production this will be the IP address of the admin’s trusted location.

### Storage
- 🔵 There must be a location available where bootstrap scripts become available. This script should not be publicly accessible.	
- 🟠 Scripts:
    - Installation scripts
    - Configuration scripts
    - Post deployment scripts
    - No expiration date for the stored scripts
    - Access to the scripts: admin & machines/processes that call the scripts

### Backup
- 🔵 The web server must be backed up daily. The backups must be retained for 7 days.
- 🔵 Backup available should it be necessary to restore the servers to a previous state.
- 🟠 Recovery Point Objective (RPO): 24 hours.
- 🟠 Recovery Time Objective (RTO): 1 hour.
- 🟠 Back-up should preferably take place at a time that it is not busy. 4 AM for example.

### Security
- 🔵 Much value is attached to the security of data at rest and in motion. All data must be encrypted.
- 🔵 All VM disks must be encrypted.
- 🟠 VM encryption: industry standard.
- 🔵 All subnets must be protected by a firewall at subnet level.
- 🔵 SSH or RDP connections to the web server may only be established from the admin server.

### Budget
- 🟠 As cheaply as possible within the necessary requirements.
- 🟠 Development: maximum €10.
- 🟠 Production: maximum €150.

### Global
- 🔵 Don’t be afraid to propose or implement improvements in the architecture, but make hard choices so you can meet the deadline.
