# <a id="top">Final Project</a>
In recent months I have learned a lot about the cloud and applied this knowledge to relatively small assignments. This will now all come together in this final project in which I improve and automate an existing architecture.

My assignment is to help a company with the transition to the cloud. The company had its infrastructure analyzed by a previous team. A diagram has been made based on the current situation.

I will build the Infrastructure as Code app to bring this design to the cloud. This will be done using the AWS Cloud Development Kit for Python.

During the project I will work on solutions while dealing with company policies, end-user demands, colleague demands, and the time pressure of a large project in a limited time.
