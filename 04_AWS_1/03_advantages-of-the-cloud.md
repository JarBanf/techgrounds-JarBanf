**The six advantages of cloud computing:**  

**- Trade Capital expense (CapEx) for variable expense (OpEx)**: Instead of having to invest heavily in data centers and servers before you know how you're going to use them, you can pay only when you consume computing resources, and pay only for how much you consume.

**- Stop spending money on running and maintaining data centers**


**- Go global in minutes**
