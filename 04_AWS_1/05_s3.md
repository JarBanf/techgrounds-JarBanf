By default, Amazon S3 blocks public access to your account and buckets.  
Edit block public access (bucket settings):

Add bucket policy that makes my bucket content publicly available:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::mygremlinbucket/*"
        }
    ]
}
```
