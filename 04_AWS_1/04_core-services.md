| Service | In Short | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Amazon EC2 | Create and run virtual servers in the cloud | Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, a web service that provides resizable computing capacity, literally servers in Amazon's data centers, that you use to build and host your software systems. |
| AWS Lambda | Run code without thinking about servers. | With AWS Lambda, you can run code without provisioning or managing servers. You pay only for the compute time that you consume, there's no charge when your code isn't running. You can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service, all with zero administration. Just upload your code and Lambda takes care of everything required to run and scale your code with high availability. |
| AWS Elastic Beanstalk | Run and manage web apps | Quickly deploy and manage applications in the AWS Cloud without worrying about the infrastructure that runs those applications. AWS Elastic Beanstalk reduces management complexity without restricting choice or control. You simply upload your application, and AWS Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the details of capacity provisioning, load balancing, scaling, and application health monitoring. |
| Amazon VPC | Isolated Cloud Resources | Amazon Virtual Private Cloud enables you to provision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWSresources in a virtual network that you've defined. |
| Amazon Route 53 | Scalable DNS and domain name registration | Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web service. |
| Amazon S3 | Scalable storage in the cloud | Amazon Simple Storage Service is storage for the internet. You can use Amazon S3 to store and retrieve any amount of data at anytime, from anywhere on the web. |
| Amazon S3 Glacier | Archive storage in the cloud | Provides durable and extremely low-cost storage for infrequently used data with security features for data archiving and backup. |
| Amazon CloudFront | Global content delivery network | Amazon CloudFront speeds up distribution of your static and dynamic web content, such as .html, .css, .php, image, and media files. When users request your content, CloudFront delivers it through a worldwide network of edge locations that provide low latency and high performance. |
| Amazon RDS | Managed relational database service | Amazon Relational Database Service makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. it provides cost-efficient, resizable capacity for an industry-standard relational database and manages common database administration tasks. |
| Amazon DynamoDB | Managed NoSQL database service | Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability. You can use Amazon DynamoDB to create a database table that can store and retrieve any amount of data, and serve any level of request traffic. Amazon DynamoDB automatically spreads the data and traffic for the table over a sufficient number of serversto handle the request capacity specified by the customer and the amount of data stored, while maintaining consistent and fast performance. |
| Amazon CloudWatch | Monitor resources and applications | Provides a reliable, scalable, and flexible monitoring solution that you can start using within minutes. You no longer need to set up, manage, and scale your own monitoring systems and infrastructure. |
| Amazon CloudFormation | Create and manage resources with templates | Enables you to create and provision AWS infrastructure deployments predictably and repeatedly. It helps you leverage AWS products such as EC2, Elastic Block Store, SNS, Elastic Load Balancing, and Auto Scaling to build highly reliable, highly scalable, cos-effective applications in the cloud without worrying about creating and configuring the underlying AWS infrastructure. AWS CloudFormation enables you to use a template file to create and delete a collection of resources together as a single unit (a stack). |
| AWS Identity and Access Management | Manage access to AWS resources | AWS Identity and Access Management is a web service for securely controlling access to AWS services. With IAM, you can centrally manage users, security credentials such as keys, and permissions that control which AWS resources users and applications can access. |
