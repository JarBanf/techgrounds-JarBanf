**1. The four advantages of the AWS pricing model**  
- **Pay-as-you-go**: With AWS you only pay for what you use. Pay-as-you-go pricing allows you to easily adapt to changing business needs without overcommitting budgets and improving your responsiveness to changes.
- **Save when you commit**: Savings Plans is a flexible pricing model that provides significant savings on your AWS usage. This pricing model offers lower prices on AWS Compute and AWS Machine Learning. Savings Plans offer savings over On-Demand in exchange for a commitment to use a specific amount (measured in $/hour) of an AWS service or a category of services, for one- or three-year period.
- **Pay less by using more**: With AWS, you can get volume based discounts and realize important savings as your usage increases. For services such as S3 and data transfer OUT from EC2, pricing is tiered, meaning the more you use, the less you pay per GB. In addition, data transfer IN is always free of charge. <ins>4.) As a result, as your AWS usage needs increase, you benefit from the economics of scale that allow you to increase adoptation and keep costs under control.</ins>
