**1. The four advantages of the AWS pricing model**  
- **Pay-as-you-go**: With AWS you only pay for what you use. Pay-as-you-go pricing allows you to easily adapt to changing business needs without overcommitting budgets and improving your responsiveness to changes.
- **Save when you commit**: Savings Plans is a flexible pricing model that provides significant savings on your AWS usage. This pricing model offers lower prices on AWS Compute and AWS Machine Learning. Savings Plans offer savings over On-Demand in exchange for a commitment to use a specific amount (measured in $/hour) of an AWS service or a category of services, for one- or three-year period.
- **Pay less by using more**: With AWS, you can get volume based discounts and realize important savings as your usage increases. For services such as S3 and data transfer OUT from EC2, pricing is tiered, meaning the more you use, the less you pay per GB. In addition, data transfer IN is always free of charge. <ins>4.) As a result, as your AWS usage needs increase, you benefit from the economics of scale that allow you to increase adoptation and keep costs under control.</ins>

**2. Aws free tier for:**  

The AWS Free Tier enables you to gain free, hands-on experience with more than 60 products on AWS. AWS Free Tier includes the following free offer types:
- Free trials: These offers are short-term free trials starting from date you activate a particular service. Once the trial period expires, you simply pay standard, pay-as-you-go service rates.

- 12 Months Free: These tier offers include 12 months of free usage following your initial sign-up date to AWS. When your 12-month free usage term expires, or if your application use exceeds the tiers, you simply pay standard, pay-as-you-go service rates.

**3. Understand the differences between capex and opex**

CAPEX, capital expenditure.  
OPEX, operating expenditure.  
Both expenditures involve spending money for the benefit of the business.

<ins>CAPEX</ins>  
CAPEX is money invested to purchase, maintain or upgrade both physical and intangible assets. For example, purchasing a new software platform or upgrading machinery on a factory floor would both be considered CAPEX.  
The 5 defining characteristics of CAPEX are:
- provide long-term benefits
- substantial monetary investment
- high value, impact and risk
- enable growth and sustainability when done properly
- negatively impact the business if unwisely invested and may be hard to reverse

<ins>OPEX</ins>  
OPEX are the recurring expenses that business must pay to keep the organization running, like employee wages, equipment rentals, and office supplies. While CAPEX is intended to increase the long-term value of the business, OPEX is about keeping the lights on and the business productive.  
The 5 defining characteristics of OPEX are:
- provide short-term benefits
- tend to be a lower up-front cost
- recurring, predictable, and flexible expenses
- part of day-to-day operating overhead
- less impactfull to the business if inappropriate and can be more easily reversed
