Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fully managed message queuing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It enables you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications by allowing components to communicate asynchronously.

- What problem does SQS solve?
    - <ins>Decoupling</ins>: Enables components to communicate without knowing each other's details, promoting flexibility and scaling.
    - <ins>Asynchronous Communication</ins>: Allows independent operation of services, reducing dependencies and failures.
    - <ins>Scalability and Load Handling</ins>: Absorbs varying workloads, buffering traffic spikes to prevent overwhelming downstream components.
    - <ins>Reliability and Fault Tolerance</ins>: Ensures high availability and redundancy to prevent message loss even during failures.
    - <ins>Message Prioritization and Ordering</ins>: FIFO queues guarantee message processing order, crucial for ordered operations.
    - <ins>Managed Service</ins>: Fully managed by AWS, reducing operational overhead for developers.
    - <ins>Integration</ins>: Seamlessly integrates with other AWS services for easy communication between different parts of an application or system.
