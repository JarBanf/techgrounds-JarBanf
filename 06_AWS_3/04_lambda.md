# Lambda

With AWS Lambda, you can run code without provisioning or managing servers. You pay only for the compute time that you consume, there's no charge when your code isn't running. You can run code for virtually any type of application or backend serviceâ€”all with zero administration. Just upload your code and Lambda takes care of everything required to run and scale your code with high availability.

AWS Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers.

Lambda runs code on a high-availability compute infrastructure and performs all of the administration of the compute resources, including server and operating system maintenance, capacity provisioning and automatic scaling, and logging. With Lambda, all you need to do is supply your code in one of the language runtimes that Lambda supports.

You organize your code into Lambda functions. The Lambda service runs your function only when needed and scales automatically. You only pay for the compute time that you consume, there is no charge when your code is not running.
