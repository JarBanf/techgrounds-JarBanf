Amazon CloudWatch monitors your AWS resources and the applications you run on AWS in real time. You can use CloudWatch to collect and track metrics, which are variables you can measure for your resources and applications.  

The CloudWatch home page automatically displays metrics about every AWS service you use. You can additionally create custom dashboards to display metrics about your custom applications, and display custom collections of metrics that you choose.

You can create alarms that watch metrics and send notifications or automatically make changes to the resources you are monitoring when a treshold is breached.

Witch CloudWatch, you gain system-wide visibility into resources utilization, application performance, and operational health.

- What problem does CloudWatch solve?
    - Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service provided by AWS that helps you collect and track metrics, collect and monitor log files, set alarms, and automatically react to changes in your AWS resources.
        - <ins>Monitoring Resources</ins>: CloudWatch alows you to monitor various AWS resources such as EC2 instances, S3 buckets, RDS databases, Lambda functions, and more. It collects and tracks metrics, giving you insight into health, performance, and utilization of these resources.
        - <ins>Metrics and Dashboards</ins>: CloudWatch collects metrics in the form of data points over time. You can create customized dashboards to visualize these metrics, making it easier to understand and analyze the performance of your applications or infrastructure.
        - <ins>Alarms and Notifications</ins>: You can set alarms based on tresholds for specific metrics. When an alarm is triggered, CloudWatch can notify you through various means like email, SMS, or triggering other AWS services to automate responses, allowing you to take proactive actions to resolve issues before they impact your system.
        - <ins>Log Monitoring and Analysis</ins>: CloudWatch Logs allows you to collect, monitor, and analyze log data generated by your AWS resources and applications. This helps in troubleshooting issues, understanding system behavior, and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.
        - <ins>Automation and Scaling</ins>: CloudWatch can be integrated with Auto Scaling to automate the scaling of your resources based on predefined conditions and tresholds. This enables you to automatically adjust resources to meet demand or optimize costs.

- Which key terms belong to CloudWatch?
    - <ins>Metrics</ins>: These are the fundamental data points that CloudWatch collects and monitors. Metrics represents a time-ordered set of data points published to CloudWatch.
    - <ins>Alarms</ins>: Alarms allows you to set tresholds on your CloudWatch metrics. You can define actions to be triggered when certain conditions are met, such as sending notifications or triggering automated responses.
    - <ins>Dashboards</ins>: Dashboards provide customizable views of your metrics, allowing you to create visual representations to monitor the health and performance of your resources.
    - <ins>Logs</ins>: Logs allows you to collect, monitor, and store log files from various AWS services and applications in a centralized location. It enables you to search, filter, and gain insights from log data.
    - <ins>Events</ins>: Events enables you to respond to state changes in your AWS resources. You can create rules to match events and trigger automated actions in response, such as invoking AWS Lambda functions.

- How does CloudWatch fit-in/replace an on-premises setting?
    - <ins>Scalability</ins>: CloudWatch easily scales to monitor thousands of resources across various AWS services, while on-premises solutions often have limited scalability.
    - <ins>Pay-As-You-Go</ins>: CloudWatch follows a pay-as-you-go model, eliminating upfront costs associated with hardware and licensing in on-premises environments.
    - <ins>Automation and Intgration</ins>: CloudWatch integrates seamlessly with AWS services, allowing automated actions based on predefined thresholds, which can be challenging in on-premises environments.
    - <ins>Managed Service</ins>: CloudWatch is a fully managed service, removing the need for manual setup and maintenance as required in on-premises solutions.
    - <ins>Global Monitoring</ins>: CloudWatch operates across AWS regions, providing centralized monitoring for resources deployed globally, unlike on-premises systems that might struggle with global reach.

- How can I combine CloudWatch with other services?
    - <ins>EC2</ins>: Monitor and auto-scale instances based on metrics like CPU, disk, and network usage.
    - <ins>RDS</ins>: Set alarms for database metrics like CPU, memory, and storage to ensure optimal performance.
    - <ins>ELB</ins>: Track and optimize load balancer performance using metrics such as requests and latency.
    - <ins>Lambda</ins>: Monitor and set alerts for errors or specific patterns in Lambda function logs.
    - <ins>S3</ins>: Monitor buckets usage metrics and set alerts for unusual activity or errors.
    - <ins>CloudTrail</ins>: Automate responses to AWS account changes for API activity using CloudWatch events.
    - <ins>Elastic Beanstalk</ins>: Monitor application metrics and logs for Elastic Beanstalk environments.

- What is the difference between CloudWatch and other similar services?
    - ?

- Where can I find this service in the console?
    - Under the "Management & Governance" category.
- How do I enable this service?
    - CloudWatch is automatically enabled for most AWS services, but you might need to configure certain services or resources to send metrics and logs to CloudWatch for monitoring and analysis.

- How can I link this service to other resources?
    - To link CloudWatch to these resources, you'll generally need to:

        - Enable monitoring or install CloudWatch agents (where applicable).
        - Configure the specific metrics you want to monitor and set up alarms to receive notifications for any thresholds you define.
