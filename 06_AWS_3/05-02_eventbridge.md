# EventBridge

Amazon EventBridge is a serverless event bus service that makes it easy to connect your applications with data from a variety of sources. EventBridge delivers a stream of real-time data from your own applications, software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications, and AWS services and routes that data to targets such as AWS Lambda. You can set up routing rules to determine where to send your data to build application architectures that react in real time to all of your data sources. EventBridge enables you to build event-driven architectures that are loosely coupled and distributed.

EventBridge is a serverless service that uses events to connect application components together, making it easier for you to build scalable event-driven applications. Event-driven architecture is a style of building loosely-coupled software systems that work together by emitting and responding to events. Event-driven architecture can help you boost agility and build reliable, scalable applications.

Use EventBridge to route events from sources such as home-grown applications, AWS services, and third-party software to consumer applications across your organization. EventBridge provides simple and consistent ways to ingest, filter, transform, and deliver events so you can build applications quickly.

EventBridge includes two ways to process events: event buses and pipes.

- An event bus is a router that receives events and delivers them to zero or more destinations, or targets. Event buses are well-suited for routing events from many sources to many targets, with optional transformation of events prior to delivery to a target.

- Amazon EventBridge Pipes connects sources to targets. Pipes are intended for point-to-point integrations between supported sources and targets, with support for advanced transformations and enrichment. It reduces the need for specialized knowledge and integration code when developing event-driven architectures, fostering consistency across your companyâ€™s applications.

- What problem does EventBridge solve?
    - AWS EventBridge is designed to simplify the creation of event-driven architectures by providing a centralized event bus. It allows various services to communicate through events without tight coupling, enabling seamless integration between AWS services, SaaS applications, and custom systems. EventBridge handles event routing, filtering, and scaling, making it easier to manage, monitor, and scale event-driven workflows while promoting reliability and scalability.

- Which key terms belong to EventBridge?
    - <ins>Event Bus</ins>: A communication channel or stream that acts as a central hub for routing events from event sources to event targets. Event buses can be either default buses or custom buses.
    - <ins>Event</ins>: Represents a significant occurrence or activity in a system, such as a change in state or a trigger generated by an application or service.
    - <ins>Event Pattern</ins>: A structured JSON object used within rules to match specific event types or properties, allowing for more precise event filtering.
    - <ins>Rule</ins>: Defines the criteria for matching incoming events and determines which targets should receive those events. Rules enable event filtering and routing.
    - <ins>Target</ins>: Represents the destination where matched events are sent. Targets can be AWS services, Lambda functions, SNS topics, SQS queues, Kinesis streams, EventBridge buses, or custom HTTP endpoints.
    - <ins>Pipe</ins>: routes events from a single source to a single target. The pipe also includes the ability to filter for specific events, and to perform enrichments on the event data before it is sent to the target.

- How does EventBridge fit-in/replace an on-premises setting?
    - AWS EventBridge can play a significant role in replacing or enhancing certain aspects of an on-premises event-driven architecture. Adopting EventBridge can augment on-premises setups by integrating with cloud services, providing scalability, and simplifying event-driven architectures without the need for extensive on-premises infrastructure management.

- How can I combine EventBridge with other services?
    - <ins>Amazon SNS</ins>: EventBridge can route events to Amazon SNS topics, allowing you to send notifications or messages to subscribed endpoints such as email, SMS, HTTP, or other AWS services.
    - <ins>Amazon EC2</ins>: You can use EventBridge to trigger actions on EC2 instances, such as starting, stopping, or terminating instances based on events, helping in automated instance management.
    - <ins>Amazon S3</ins>: EventBridge can be configured to respond to events related to changes in Amazon S3 buckets, like object creation, deletion, or modification, triggering subsequent actions or workflows.
    - <ins>Amazon DynamoDB</ins>: Events generated from changes in DynamoDB tables can be captured by EventBridge, allowing you to respond to database changes and trigger automated actions or updates in other services.
    - <ins>AWS Lambda</ins>: You can use EventBridge as a trigger for AWS Lambda functions. When an event matches a defined rule, EventBridge can invoke a Lambda function, allowing you to execute custom code, perform data processing, or initiate specific actions based on the received event.

In this tutorial, I'll create a function to use as the target for the EventBridge rule using the Lambda console. Then, I'll create an archive and a rule that will archive test events using the EventBridge console. Once there are events in that archive, I'll replay them.

- Create a Lambda function to log the events.

```js
'use strict';

exports.handler = (event, context, callback) => {
    console.log('LogScheduledEvent');
    console.log('Received event:', JSON.stringify(event, null, 2));
    callback(null, 'Finished');
};
```

- Create archive that will hold all the test events.
