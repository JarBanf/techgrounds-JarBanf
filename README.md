## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Jared
#### Welcome to my Cloud Engineer course repository. 
Here I document my projects and assignment from the course at [Techgrounds](https://techgrounds.nl/).  
<br>

### Gain knowledge & pass AWS CCP exam
In recent months I have learned a lot about the cloud and applied this knowledge to relatively small assignments (folders 01 to 09).

During this time I also obtained my [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification](/07-08_I-passed-my-AWS-CCP-exam/).  
<br>

### Final Project
The knowledge and experience I gained will now all come together in my final project in which I improve and automate an existing architecture using the AWS CDK IaC for Python.
